- Confirmed Windsor connectors via `get_connectors`: `google_my_business` account
  `locations/17253298120475111002` = "Deep Dive Trips" ✅, `facebook_organic` account
  `1068114356395128` = "Deep Dive Trips" ✅ — both match the standing config, no changes by the
  account owner.
- Attempted a real GMB media read (`get_data` on `google_my_business`, fields incl.
  `media_category`, `media_format`, `media_view_count`) to make today's photo/video gap list
  specific instead of generic. Got the plan-limit error: *"reads are paused because you have 14
  accounts connected and your Free plan includes 1 account."* Same known blocker already listed
  in TASKS.md under "Blocked on you" — not retried, logged here per the standing rule and moved on
  with a framework-based deliverable instead of real counts.
- Completed Day 4 (GMB photo/video gap list + shot list) — see
  `day4-gmb-photo-video-gap-list.md`. Nothing published (not a GMB-post task, and
  `business-info.md` still doesn't exist).
- `business-info.md` still not present in the repo — still the single biggest unlock per
  TASKS.md; Day 5 (next up: second week of GMB posts) will again need placeholders unless it's
  added before the next run.
